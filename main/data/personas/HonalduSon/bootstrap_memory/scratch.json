An important part of his day is harvesting ripe fruits and vegetables. At 12 p.m., take a short break, and perform equipment maintenance and repairs. If there are livestock in the afternoon, I take care of them. I leave work at 4 p.m., feeding and watering the animals. After that, they go around the village and greet the villagers. I come back home to have dinner at 6 p.m. After eating dinner, I take a short shower and relax at home. I go to sleep at 11 p.m",
